# Machine Learning for Mahindra First Choice: A Master's Capstone Project
This was my capstone project during my Data Science Master's program at GreyAtom institute. <br>
The dataset was provided by Mahindra. Mahindra First Choice Wheels is Indiaâ€™s leading used auto platform business which is organizing the market by aggregating demand and supply. <br>
The aim of this project is to understand ownership and spending patterns of customers throughout the country and to calculate customer LTV (Lifetime Value). <br>
Worked as a team wherein I designed and evaluated a number of ML models out of which Random Forest outperformed the rest. <br>
Tools used were Pandas, Tableau, Sklearn, Git, SciPy. <br>
Succeeded to find useful insights in data and showcased it as an interactive visualization. Reached model accuracy of 0.97 and earned team reputation for best EDA and presentation. <br>
A final powerpoint presentation is added as well that can be referred to get a better idea about the project. <br>
The code is available in the form of Python notebooks.
