This was my capstone project during my Masters program at GreyAtom institute.
The dataset was provided by Mahindra Company.
The function of this project is to understand ownership and spending patterns of customers throughout the country and to calculate customer LTV (Lifetime Value).
Worked as a team wherein I designed and evaluated a number of ML models out of which Random Forest outperformed the rest.
Tools used were Pandas, Tableau, Sklearn, Git, SciPy.
Succeeded to find useful insights in data and showcased it as an interactive visualization. Reached model accuracy of 0.97 and earned team reputation for best EDA and presentation.
A final powerpoint presentation is also added which can be refferred to get a better idea about this whole project.
