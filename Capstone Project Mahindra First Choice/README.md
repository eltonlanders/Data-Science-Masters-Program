This was my capstone project during my Masters program at GreyAtom institute. <br>
The dataset was provided by Mahindra Company. <br>
The function of this project is to understand ownership and spending patterns of customers throughout the country and to calculate customer LTV (Lifetime Value). <br>
Worked as a team wherein I designed and evaluated a number of ML models out of which Random Forest outperformed the rest. <br>
Tools used were Pandas, Tableau, Sklearn, Git, SciPy. <br>
Succeeded to find useful insights in data and showcased it as an interactive visualization. Reached model accuracy of 0.97 and earned team reputation for best EDA and presentation. <br>
A final powerpoint presentation is also added here which can be refferred to get a better idea about this whole project. <br>
The code is available in the form of python notebooks
