### Project Overview

 This project is all about working with data to get meaningful insights about citizens, their income and the loan parameters regarding their income.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project I got a good hands on how to clean the data and make it usable to get insights. Also I learned how to derive insights from the data.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First of all, I took out the time to look and observe the data. I observed what each row and column meant. Then it was easier to work and solve the data.


### Challenges faced

 One challenge for me was that the the 'Not available' values were scattered everywhere. But with useful functions like fillna() and dropna() I solved the issue.


### Additional pointers

 No thanks.
