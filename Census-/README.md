### Project Overview

 I have completed this project on a dataset of census to gain meaning insights and make inference.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how to efficiently use numpy arrays and its various funtions and methods in real life datasets.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach that I took was pretty straigh-forward. I sorted the data first and applied the applicabe functions wherever possible.


### Challenges faced

 Some challenges that I faced were that the indexing was a bit tricky but once I got a hang of it there was no looking back.


### Additional pointers

 No thanks.
